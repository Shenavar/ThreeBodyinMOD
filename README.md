These codes are used to build the plots in my manuscript entitled "Three-Body Problem in Modified Dynamics". The codes are written in MATHEMATICA 10.0 and compiled on UBUNTU 18.04, memory 7.7 GiB and a core i7-6500U CPU.  
The codes related to figures 2, 3, 4, 5 and all figures related to the section "Simple PRTBP Laboratory" are provided here. If you find these codes useful, you cite the manscript as follows
